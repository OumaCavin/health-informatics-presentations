\section{Definitions and Conceptual Framework}
\subsection{Definition of Electronic Health Records}

\begin{frame}{What are Electronic Health Records?}
    \begin{block}{WHO Definition}
        An electronic health record (EHR) is a ``systematic collection of electronic health information about individual patients or populations'' that is ``capable of being shared across different health care settings'' through networked, enterprise-wide information systems or other information networks and exchanges \cite{who2009}.
    \end{block}
    
    \pause
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Scope}: Goes beyond basic patient demographics to include medical history, medications, allergies, immunization status, laboratory results, vital signs, and billing information
        \item \textbf{Interoperability}: The capacity for EHR systems to exchange and make use of information across organizational and geographic boundaries
        \item \textbf{Purpose}: Support continuity of care, clinical decision-making, public health surveillance, health system planning, and research
    \end{itemize}

    \smallskip
    
    EHRs intersect with all six WHO health systems building blocks, making their implementation particularly complex in resource-constrained environments \cite{who2007}.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Systems Thinking Framework for EHR Implementation}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Linear vs. Systems Approach}: Traditional implementation often assumes a linear ``deploy and adopt'' model; systems thinking recognizes recursive feedback loops, emergent properties, and interdependencies
        \item \textbf{Complexity Science Perspective}: EHR implementation in LMICs represents a complex adaptive system with multiple interacting agents (patients, providers, administrators, policymakers, technology vendors)
        \item \textbf{Conceptual Model}: The CHIMERA framework (Context, Hardware, Infrastructure, Management, End-users, Regulations, Adaptation) provides a lens for analyzing EHR implementation challenges in low-resource settings \cite{luna2014}
        \item \textbf{Feedback Loops}: Infrastructure investments affect workforce capacity; workforce training affects adoption rates; adoption affects data quality; data quality affects perceived value and continued investment
    \end{itemize}

                Rural health facilities in LMICs frequently experience:
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Unreliable grid electricity (average 8-12 hours/day in sub-Saharan Africa)
                    \item Voltage fluctuations damaging sensitive equipment
                    \item Complete absence of electricity in remote areas
                    \item Limited or no backup power systems

        According to ITU data, while mobile network coverage reaches approximately 85\% of the African population, broadband connectivity in rural areas remains below 30\% \cite{itu2022}. This ``last mile'' problem means even where networks exist, the bandwidth required for EHR operations is unavailable at the point of care.

    \smallskip
    
    According to WHO, 57 countries (36 in sub-Saharan Africa) have critical health workforce shortages below the minimum threshold of 22.8 health workers per 10,000 population \cite{who2020}. This workforce crisis directly constrains EHR adoption.

\begin{frame}{Digital Literacy and Computer Skills Gap}
    \begin{columns}
        \begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
            \begin{block}{Training Challenges}
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Variable computer literacy among health workers, particularly older staff
                    \item Limited exposure to structured data entry and management principles
                    \item Insufficient training time due to clinical workload pressures
                    \item Training often conducted in urban centers, excluding rural workers
                    \item Rapid staff turnover requiring repeated training cycles
                \end{itemize}

        \begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}
            \begin{block}{Kenya Case Study}
                An evaluation of the KenyaEMR system in Nyanza Province found that 45\% of health workers reported ``difficulty using computers'' as a major barrier to adoption, with training duration averaging only 2 days per facility \cite{ Were2013}.

    \end{columns}
    
    \pause
    
    \begin{block}{Critical Insight}
        Technology adoption models developed in high-income countries often overestimate baseline digital literacy. In many LMIC rural settings, EHR implementation requires foundational computer skills training before introducing the system itself.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Specialized Informatics Capacity}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Health Informatics Experts}: There is a severe global shortage of professionals with combined expertise in health sciences, information systems, and public health—particularly acute in LMICs
        \item \textbf{Local IT Support}: Rural facilities often lack on-site IT personnel, leading to delayed troubleshooting and extended system downtime
        \item \textbf{Data Management Capacity}: Skills in data analysis, interpretation, and visualization needed to realize EHR benefits are frequently absent at facility level
        \item \textbf{Change Management}: Organizational change management skills essential for successful technology transitions are rarely available
    \end{itemize}
    
    \pause
    
    \begin{block}{Brain Drain Phenomenon}
        Health workers who develop informatics skills often migrate to urban areas or international positions, creating a persistent ``skills drain'' that undermines sustainable capacity building in rural facilities \cite{eksteen2021}.

    \begin{block}{The Sustainability Challenge}
        Initial implementation grants often cover capital and implementation costs but leave no provision for long-term operational expenses, creating ``zombie systems'' that become increasingly non-functional over time \cite{heeks2006}.

                \begin{itemize}
                    \item Vertical disease programs (HIV, TB, malaria) often fund parallel EHR systems
                    \item Donor priorities may not align with national health information strategies
                    \item Systems designed for specific diseases lack integration capacity
                    \item Withdrawal of donor funding creates sustainability crises

        Rwanda's successful EHR expansion was enabled by government commitment to allocate 5\% of the national health budget to health information systems, creating predictable multi-year funding streams \cite{nyirabagabo2020}.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Return on Investment Challenges}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Delayed Benefits}: Cost savings and efficiency gains from EHRs typically materialize 3-5 years post-implementation
        \item \textbf{Intangible Benefits}: Improvements in care quality, patient safety, and public health surveillance are difficult to monetize for ROI calculations
        \item \textbf{Measurement Difficulties}: Baseline data on current paper-based system inefficiencies is often unavailable
        \item \textbf{Opportunity Costs}: Resources invested in EHRs are not available for direct clinical services
    \end{itemize}
    
    \pause
    
    \begin{block}{Economic Modeling}
        Studies from high-income countries show EHR ROI of 5-10 years; in LMICs with lower baseline costs of paper systems and higher implementation costs, the breakeven point may never be reached under current cost structures \cite{fleming2014}.

        \item \textbf{Unintended Consequences}: Documentation burden, alert fatigue, and clinician dissatisfaction associated with EHRs may indirectly harm outcomes through reduced time for patient care

    EHR implementation in rural and resource-constrained settings requires navigating multiple interacting challenges that cannot be addressed in isolation.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Key Takeaways}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{Complexity}: EHR implementation in LMICs is fundamentally different from high-income settings—technical solutions alone are insufficient
        \item \textbf{Systems Thinking}: A holistic approach recognizing feedback loops, interdependencies, and context-specific factors is essential
        \item \textbf{Long-term Perspective}: Sustainability requires addressing financing, workforce, and governance before, during, and after implementation
        \item \textbf{Equity Focus}: Without deliberate attention, EHRs risk exacerbating rather than reducing health inequities
        \item \textbf{Local Ownership}: Successful implementation depends on local capacity building, community engagement, and government commitment
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \pause
    
    \begin{block}{The Path Forward}
        Progress requires coordinated action across multiple stakeholders: governments prioritizing health information systems, donors aligning with national strategies, implementers using evidence-based approaches, and communities engaged as partners rather than passive subjects.
    \end{block}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Final Thought}
    \begin{center}
        \begin{quotation}
            \textit{``The goal is not to implement technology for its own sake, but to strengthen health systems and improve health outcomes. In resource-constrained settings, this requires creative, context-appropriate solutions that balance innovation with pragmatism.''}
        \end{quotation}
    \end{center}
    
    \bigskip
    
    EHRs are a means to an end—better health for rural and underserved populations. Keeping this focus sharp is essential as we navigate the challenges ahead.
