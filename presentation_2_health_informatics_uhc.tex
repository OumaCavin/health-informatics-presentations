\section{Universal Health Coverage: Definitions and Dimensions}

\begin{frame}{What is Universal Health Coverage?}
    \begin{block}{WHO Definition}
        Universal Health Coverage (UHC) means that ``all people have access to the full spectrum of quality health services they need, when and where they need them, without financial hardship'' \cite{who2019}. It encompasses the full continuum of essential health services, from health promotion to prevention, treatment, rehabilitation, and palliative care.
    \end{block}
    
    \pause
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Population Coverage}: Who is covered? Ensuring all population groups, including marginalized and hard-to-reach populations, have access to services
        \item \textbf{Service Coverage}: What services are covered? Providing a comprehensive package of essential health interventions across the care continuum
        \item \textbf{Financial Protection}: How much does it cost? Ensuring that health payments do not push people into poverty or cause catastrophic expenditure
    \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

    Service coverage includes promotive, preventive, curative, rehabilitative, and palliative care services across the lifespan. The Lancet UHC Global Monitoring Database tracks coverage of essential health service interventions across 204 countries \cite{fullman2018}.

                    \item \textbf{Impoverishment due to health spending}: Households pushed below the poverty line by health expenditures
                    \item \textbf{Service utilization without financial ruin}: Ability to access care without selling assets or borrowing
                \end{itemize}

            \begin{block}{The Poverty Connection}
                An estimated 100 million people are pushed into extreme poverty annually due to out-of-pocket health expenses, while 800 million spend at least 10\% of their household budgets on healthcare \cite{who2019}. This financial toxicity directly undermines UHC objectives.

        Target 3.8 of the Sustainable Development Goals specifically calls for achieving financial risk protection, noting that without addressing affordability, access alone is insufficient to achieve UHC.

    \begin{block}{The Equity Imperative}
        UHC is fundamentally an equity concept. A health system that provides excellent care to urban populations while excluding rural communities, the poor, or marginalized groups has not achieved universal coverage. Equity-focused monitoring disaggregates coverage by wealth quintile, geography, sex, and other stratifiers \cite{boerma2014}.

    The WHO health systems framework identifies six building blocks that must function together to achieve health system goals. Health information systems (HIS) serve as the ``backbone'' that supports decision-making across all other blocks \cite{who2007}.

            \begin{block}{The Feedback Loop}
                High-functioning HIS generate data that informs decisions across all blocks, while well-functioning blocks generate the data needed for HIS. Weakness in any component creates ripple effects throughout the system.

        Investments in health informatics must be understood as system-wide interventions, not isolated technology projects. TheHIS should be conceptualized as the nervous system of the health sector.

        \item \textbf{Outreach Automation}: Reminder systems can target populations lagging in preventive service uptake

        Systematic reviews find that health informatics interventions most consistently improve process measures (documentation completeness, service utilization) with more variable effects on health outcomes. The pathway from data to outcomes is mediated by multiple factors including system design, implementation quality, and health system context \cite{chaudhry2019}.

\section{Conclusions}

\begin{frame}{Summary: Informatics for UHC}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \textbf{UHC is the goal}: Service coverage, financial protection, and equity represent the three dimensions that health informatics must support
        \item \textbf{Informatics is enabling, not sufficient}: Technology alone does not achieve UHC—strong health systems, workforce, and financing are prerequisite
        \item \textbf{Integration is essential}: Greatest impact comes from interoperable systems rather than isolated tools
        \item \textbf{Equity must be intentional}: Without deliberate focus on underserved populations, informatics may widen gaps
        \item \textbf{Implementation matters most}: Technology selection is less important than implementation quality, user engagement, and sustained financing
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \pause
    
    \begin{block}{Key Insight}
        Health informatics represents a powerful tool for accelerating progress toward UHC, but only when deployed as part of comprehensive health system strengthening strategies with sustained political commitment and adequate resources.

    \begin{block}{Closing Thought}
        The path to UHC is digital-enabled but fundamentally human. Technology must serve people, not the reverse. The measure of success is not data captured or systems deployed, but healthier populations living free from financial ruin.
